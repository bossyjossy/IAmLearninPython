# This is my completed exercise for Learn Python The Hard Way Exercise 1
#
# This is slightly modified from the lesson so that I can test things out
# and really see how things work.

# EXERCISE 1

# These lines show the effect of the double quotes.
print "Hello World!"
print "Hello Again"
print "I like typing this."
print "This is fun."

# This line shows that the single quotes do the same thing.
print 'Yay! Printing.'

# Single quotes within a double quote set are printed as-is.
print "I'd much rather you 'not'."

# Double quotes within a single quote set are printed as-is as well.
print 'I "said" do not touch this.'

# I tested single quotes within single quotes and that didn't work.

# I tested with one single quote without the closing quote like this:
# 'oops...what happens with one single quote?
# and it returned this error: SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string 
# literal
