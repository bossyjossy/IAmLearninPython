# EXERCISE 2: Comments and Pound Characters

# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print "I could have code written like this."  # And the comment after the pound is ignored.

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code like this:
# print "This won't print."

print "This will print."

print "This will show that the # and text afterwards is printed because it is part of a string."
